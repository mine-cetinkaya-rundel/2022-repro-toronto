# Hello Quarto!

## Rewind to TWR 2021

![](images/rewind.png){fig-alt="Rewind icon" fig-align="center"}

## In the beginning was R Markdown

[![](images/in-the-beginning-rmd.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of last slide of a previous talk titled \"In the beginning was R Markdown\". The letters in this title are shown are letters on a keyboard. Underneath the keyboard is a text box with the words \"and R Markdown continues to facilitate reproducibility, no matter your scope and experience...\" and underneath that is another text box that has a link to that slide deck: bit.ly/begin-rmd." fig-align="center"}](https://bit.ly/begin-rmd)

## Running code

There are currently two engines supported for running computations:

-   [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), for running code from Python and many other languages.

-   [Knitr](https://yihui.org/knitr/), for running code from R.

## Editing Quarto documents

You're not limited to RStudio for editing Quarto documents...

-   [JupyterLab](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/jupyter-lab.html)

-   [VS Code](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/vscode.html)

-   [Text Editors](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/text-editors.html)

## Quarto projects

Organize a collection of Quarto files in a folder as projects

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   render all or some of the files with a single command
-   share YAML configuration across multiple documents
-   redirect output artifacts to another directory
-   freeze rendered output (i.e. don't re-execute documents unless they have changed)
